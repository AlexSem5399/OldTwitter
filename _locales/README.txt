Hello! I would be very thankful if you help me to translate this extension.

There's couple of folders here, each corresponding to language code.
If you want to translate, copy "en" folder (English) and paste with renaming it to your language's 2-letter country code.
Here's list of codes: https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php. Seek for second row, ISO 639-1. If it's empty there, then sorry, you can't translate to this language.
Then open newly pasted folder and open messages.json in it. You'll now see { "message": "some text" } parts in it. You can start translating "some text" part!
Things to keep in mind:
- Some lines have "description", "example" or "placeholder" fields, it's comments for translators or placeholders. You don't have to translate them.
- !! Pay attention to texts case and symbols in it! If English version has something in lowercase, use lowercase in translation too.
- Keep \$SOMETHING_HERE$ parts unchanged.
- Place \ before " inside your text.
- Try to keep everything as short as English version, if possible (unless it's big messages)

If you're not creating new translation, but just updating new one, you can open your languages locale file and English locale file and copy missing lines from English file and translate them.

When you're finished you can send me your messages.json file to these places:
- email: admin@dimden.dev
- twitter: https://twitter.com/dimdenEFF
- discord: https://discord.gg/k4u7ddk
- github issues: https://github.com/dimdenGD/OldTwitter/issues

Thank you!
